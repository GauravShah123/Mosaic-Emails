                    <h1>Reminder: Judging at Mosaic 2025</h1>

                    <p>Dear {{NAME}},<br><br>
                        We‚Äôre excited to have you as a judge for Mosaic 2025! The competition is just one day away, and
                        we want to ensure you have all the details you need to make the day smooth and enjoyable. Please
                        read this email carefully for key information about the event, including location, schedule, and
                        judging criteria.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Event Details</h2>
                    <p>
                        üìÖ <strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, March 8, 2025 <br>
                        üìç <strong>Location:</strong> RCH (Room 301), University of Waterloo Main Campus <br>
                        üïî <strong>Time Commitment:</strong> 5:00 PM - 7:30 PM <br>
                        üöó <strong>Parking:</strong> Free parking available at UW Plaza <br>
                        üöÜ <strong>Public Transit:</strong> RCH is accessible by bus 30, 12, 29 or 202. <br>
                        üçΩÔ∏è <strong>Meals:</strong> Dinner provided <br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Judging Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        Please arrive between 4:45 PM and 5:00 PM and check in at the registration desk. At 5:00 PM, we
                        will hold a short judges‚Äô meeting where our organizers will walk you through the judging
                        criteria and case details. This will ensure you have all the information needed to assess teams
                        fairly. You will also have the opportunity to ask any questions before judging begins.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the meeting, each judge will be stationed in a separate room with a volunteer. Both judges
                        and participants will receive a schedule indicating when each team will present in their
                        assigned room. The judging will follow a structured format: each team will have 3 minutes to
                        pitch their solution, followed by a 2-minute Q&A session where you can ask clarifying questions.
                        There will be a 2-minute buffer time for teams to gather their belongings before the next group
                        enters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Judging will begin at 5:30 PM and continue until 6:30 PM. During this time, dinner will be
                        delivered to your room so you can focus on the evaluation process. Once judging is complete, we
                        will tally the scores and prepare to announce the winners.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We would love for you to attend the Closing Ceremonies from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM, where we will
                        announce the winners and present awards. Your presence would mean a lot to the participants and
                        help make the moment even more special.
                    </p>
